- **Text EN**: I came from Miami with high expectations for my weekly cuts back home, and he absolutely delivered! He comes directly to your location, whether it's your home or where you're staying. His scissor work is precise, and his fades are incredibly smooth. I asked for certain things such as: to leave my hairline natural, to shorten the length on the top. Very well detailed and extremely nice.

- **Text EN**: Hands down the best barber in Colombia. I have been coming here since 2019 and it's always been hard to find someone that can cut my hair exactly how I want it. The thing I like most is that they come directly to your house which is great because it saves me a lot of time and allows me to focus on my work. Also the main barber Stiven is very nice and interesting to talk to which makes the experience next level.

- **Text EN**: I've been to a lot of barbers in Medellin, and honestly, I don't know why I wasted my time anywhere else. This guy absolutely kills it - precision, style, and consistency every single time. Before, I was bouncing around between different barbers, but now? Forget it. I'll never let anyone else touch my hair again. He's a straight-up beast with the clippers. He takes his craft seriously, but he also makes the whole experience laid-back and fun. You walk out not just looking sharp but actually feeling like a new version of yourself. If you're not getting your haircut by him, you're playing yourself. Period.
- **Service**: Haircut, precision cuts
